I'm done with it! The largest program I've ever developed, and it's not about functionality, but about the num of lines I had to 
write in order to organize data structures in Delphi 7. Grapher is a simple program for interactive working with graphs. If you even don't know math well, Grapher will be usefull for you. You can build, save, open and rewrite graphs. With the help of mathematical sets of functions, it's able to count the shortest and the farthest ways, nodes degree, graph size, radius and so on. Try Grapher yourself! Developers, you are welcome to add anything you want (you should only create a new branch). License - WTFPL!
